# joystick-control-with-RF
This project demonstrates a basic RF communication setup using two PIC16F887 microcontrollers, based on the NEC protocol. The transmitter reads values from two potentiometers (via ADC) and sends encoded signals wirelessly. The receiver decodes these signals and displays visual feedback using an LED matrix driven by the MAX7219.
